# SIG, the self improvement game

SIG is an app with a simple premise: you achieve more when you have to work for your rewards.

It could be considered a simplified version of HabitRPG.

## Flow

In this app, you are an Achiever. Every achiever has Manado (mana-doo as in mana-for-doing). You Manado changes in several ways:

 * You get Manado by completing Achievements (an action that you want to 
   reinforce doing, either one-off or repeatable)
 * You lower Manado by using a Reward (ie something pleasurable for you)
 * You lower Manado by tripping a Punisher (an action that you want to weed out)

Thats it!


## Features

### Done

In both the API and Web Client:

 * manage Rewards, Punishments and Achievements
 * ability to lower/raise Manadoo by triggering Rewards, Punishments 
   and Achievements
 * Asana integration built in

### Planned

#### v 0.2
  
 * add user authentication
 *  



### Later

I don't want to fall prey to future creep, but there are some fun things that I might work on when I have some spare time.

 * add experience and levels - just as as fun thing, 1XP = 1 Manadoo 
   (but it doesn't deteriorate ever)
 * challenges and badges - I feel that offering the player progressively
   more challenging chains of achievements can have a positive effect 
   (ie. if you are stuck in a rut, the system will challenge you to acquire 
   100 points within 7 days.  Or it can detect that you've been letting yourself go lately 
   and suggest.

## Other considerations

### Why not HabitRPG

 * HabitRPG has gold, silver, experience, health and so on, which in my mind 
   muddles the direct correlation of achievement=reward. 
 * HabitRPG sometimes loses data (happened to me more that once) 
   or kills you off if you forget to tend to it, which is one more similiarity 
   to a cow clicker game that I can handle.
 * It is a bit infantile, which isn't really a bad thing per se, but in 
   this case it ticked me off.

### Add-ons 
 
 * Asana API as a source of achievements - This was actually the idea that 
   started this project off. I wanted to get an overall view of how productive
   I was in terms of tasks done per day, and decided it wasn't that hard to 
   build something that would moderate my reward as a result of that.
